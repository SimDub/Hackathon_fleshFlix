# Simple MVC

## Description

This repository is a project mabe by Thomas KUKLA, Elodie GEORGE, Benjamin DÃ‰SIGNE, Fred OLIVE, Simon DUBOELLE.  It was done during our 24 hour hackaton at the Web School "Wild Code School" of Nantes.
The challenge was to use an API for the first time and make a site on the halloween theme.
We made a questionnaire to know in which film could you be a potential victim

## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PWD', 'your_db_password');
```
4. Import `simple-mvc.sql` in your SQL server,
5. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
7. From this starter kit, create your own web application.

### Windows Users

If you develop on Windows, you should edit you git configuration to change your end of line rules with this command :

`git config --global core.autocrlf true`

## URLs availables

* Home page at [localhost:8000/](localhost:8000/monster/index)

## How does URL routing work ?
